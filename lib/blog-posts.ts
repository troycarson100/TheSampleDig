But using someone else's recording or composition without permission can lead to takedowns, lawsuits, or lost revenue. This guide explains the basics of copyright and sample clearance so you can make informed decisions, protect your work, and keep making beats with more confidence." },
      { type: "h2", text: "What are you actually clearing?" },
      { type: "p", text: "When you sample a recording, you're usually touching two separate copyrights. The first is the sound recording (the \"master\")—owned by the label or artist. The second is the underlying composition (the \"publishing\")—owned by the songwriter or publisher. To clear a sample properly, you typically need permission from both. That can mean two separate deals: one for the master use and one for the composition. Even short clips or heavily processed chops can trigger claims, so assume clearance is required unless you're using material explicitly cleared for use (e.g., royalty-free or licensed packs)." },

Bootlegs, mixtapes, and \"for promotional use only\" releases can still be targeted; if the rights holder finds your use, they can issue a takedown or sue. Fair use is a legal defense, but it's decided in court and doesn't apply to most beat-making. Relying on \"I'll get caught later\" is risky. If you're only making beats for yourself or for practice, the practical risk is lower, but the legal standard doesn't change. When in doubt, clear it or don't use it for public release." },

You or your rep (lawyer, clearance service) contact them with details: what you sampled, how long, how it's used, and what you're offering (e.g., upfront fee plus royalty share). They can approve, reject, or negotiate. Terms vary: one-time buyouts, per-copy royalties, or a percentage of publishing. Big-name samples can be expensive or flat-out denied.

Folder by genre, source (vinyl rip vs. pack vs. one-shots), or project type—whatever matches how you think when you're looking for a sound.

Free tools and DAW browsers often support basic metadata; a little time spent tagging pays off when you're building beats and need to filter by key or tempo." },

You can use them to create variation without loading new samples—filter sweeps, per-pad tone, and movement that makes a static loop feel alive.
